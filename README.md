# cant-stop-express rules
In Can't Stop Express, all players try to make their best use of a common roll of 5 D6. They each use the roll by putting aside 1 die value and then forming 2 pairs from the remaining 4 dice. They then mark the sums of the 2 dice pairs, as well as the value of the die put aside, and move to the next roll. In the first turn of the game, each player is supposed to put aside a different die value, which forces players to make different choices later. Players can select up to 3 put-aside values, but once these 3 values are set, one of them must be chosen on each turn, if possible. The game ends for a player when they put aside a die value for the 8th time. This means that barring free turns (when a player doesn't roll any of their put-aside values), the game usually ends after 3x7+1 = 22 dice rolls.

Once the game ends for a player, they calculate their score using their marked dice pair rolls. If they rolled a value less than 5 times, they get a 200 point penalty. Each roll beyond the 5th will provide the score for that respective dice roll.
